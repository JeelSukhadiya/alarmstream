Welcome to the home of **AlarmStream**, a clean and usable alarm clock web app built using React.js

The idea behind the app was to create a minimalist alarm application which was straightforward and intuitive to use.

This app was built largely as a learning project to gain further experience with React. I'm sharing it as I want to contribute to the open source community. 

Suggestions, improvements, and bug reports are more than welcome.
